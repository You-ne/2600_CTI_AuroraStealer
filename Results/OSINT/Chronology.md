## APRIL

- In __April 2022__ started advertised as a __Botnet__, following a __Maas__ (_Malware-as-a-service_) on Russian-speaking undeground forums, notably WWH Club (observed by (KELA)[https://ke-la.com/information-stealers-a-new-landscape/]. The advertising was coming from a threat actor named __*cheshire666*__. \[[[Sources#^462510|1]]\] He was also looking for 3-5 people to beta test the product before final release. The award was a month free.

The product would consist of:
 1. Builder (with the possibility of polymorphic compilation and compression)
 2. Stealer
 3. Clipper BTC, ETH, LTC
 4. The botnet is located on a shared dedicated server and has spare servers for migration
 5. If the server is unavailable, the bots will automatically start searching for a new server
