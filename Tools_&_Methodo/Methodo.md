# Basic search actions:
 - Google searches using names (Of the stealer, the actors, he IOCs...)
 - Ping of the IOCs IPs to see which ones are up and what fomains and content is hosted
 - Check if IOCs domains are up, on an old or new IP, and what content they are serving
 - Look on criminal forums to find anything Aurora related (dev comments, publicity, rumors, voutches...)

# Search for :
 - New redacted sources
 - IPs
 - Domains hosted on it
 - Aurora stealer or samples
 - IOCs and Yara rules
 - Names and info about dev gang/clients gangs/victims

# When something is found
 1. Check if that piece of intel is already recorded somewhere.
 2. If not in the Maltego nor the chronology, add it.
 3. Try to __always__ respect the proper entity types used in maltego.
 4. Keep the _link labels_ __conistent__, as they condition our capacity to make efficient searches and sorts in the graph!
